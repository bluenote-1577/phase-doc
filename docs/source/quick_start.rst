Install + quick start
-------

See the github repository https://github.com/bluenote-1577/floria?tab=readme-ov-file#install--quick-start for installation instructions and how to do a basic run of floria. 

In summary:

#. You can compile floria on linux and mac. 

   *  Only basic software like rust, gcc, cmake are required. 
   
#. We offer a precompiled executable for linux 

   *  Should work for > 99% of linux users 

#. Conda 

   * Floria is also available through bioconda. 

#. End-to-end snakemake pipeline

   * If you want an end-to-end reads-to-assembly snakemake pipeline, see the production workflow stated here: https://github.com/jsgounot/Floria_analysis_workflow. May take a bit more initial configuration. 

To learn more about how floria works, start with the :doc:`introduction` page and the :doc:`tutorials`, in particular, the first tutorial :doc:`tutorials/tut1` picks up from this page.
