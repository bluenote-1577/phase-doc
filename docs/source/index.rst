floria - metagenomic read-based strain phasing
===================================

floria is a software package for strain-level phasing of metagenomic sequencing samples. 

Given a BAM and a VCF file, floria clusters reads into strain-level clusters. Floria can:

* Works with **short** or **noisy long** reads (preferably long)
* Phase **metagenomic assemblies** or **single genomes**
* Multithreaded, takes minutes per contig/genome
* Minimal parameter tuning and **automatic determination of strain number**
* Give **informative visualizations and summary statistics**
